# Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a book recommendation system based on historical data to provide personalized book suggestions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system enhances users' reading experiences by recommending books that align closely with their preferences and interests.

## Dataset
The book dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about books, user interactions, and ratings that will be analyzed to generate recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and model development
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model training
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Cosine Similarity**: To calculate similarities between books for recommendation
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model
- **Streamlit**: To build an interactive web application

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features for recommendation.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Using cosine similarity to determine the closeness between books.
4. **Model Training and Saving**: Training the recommendation model and saving it using the pickle library.
5. **Web Application Development**: Implementing an interactive UI with Streamlit to allow users to input book details and receive recommendations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-system.git
   cd book-recommendation-system
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Streamlit application in your browser.
- Enter the book details or select a book from the available list.
- Receive personalized book recommendations based on similarity analysis.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
